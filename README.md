## About The Project

Paperbound is a web application built using Vue.js that allows users to search for their favourite book titles and browse their various book cover editions. 

Being an ardent reader, I was always looking out for ways to enhance the user experience of book readers like me who wish to browse their favourite books online without taking away the joy of picking them up physically from their shelves. Thus, this is a front-end application that is meant to be a user experience design case study of challenging myself to explore the ways to improve the user experience for online book browsers.
